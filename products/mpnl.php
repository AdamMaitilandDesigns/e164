<h2 class="title">MNP / ported number lookup </h2>
<p>MNP lookup is super quick and useful for:</p>

<ul>

<li>Routing SMS messages quickly and accurately</li>

<li>Routing telephone calls quickly and accurately</li>

<li>Minimising costs of SMS and VoIP by choosing a least cost routing provider</li>

<li>Ensuring SMS is delivered to the correct network</li>

<li>Filtering out SMS or calls to impossible numbers</li>

<li>Detecting fake telephone numbers used to avoid Origin Based Routing surcharges on SMS</li>

</ul>

<p>The MNP ported information is used to decide which supplier to use for the SMS or voice call so that our customers can minimise cost and ensure that the SMS or call is delivered to the correct telephone network. They want to know this portability data very quickly because they are performing the lookup whilst transiting a voice call or SMS message and the longer the lookup takes the longer the caller has to wait before the call is routed to the correct provider.</p>
