<h2 class="title">Do not originate</h2>

                <p>The national Do Not Originate schemes regulate domestic markets to ensure at-risk telephone numbers can only be presented as an originating telephone number by the authorised number holder.<br><br>


Local government departments, banks and other authorised telephone number holders can apply to add their registered telephone numbers to the national-level DNO list to restrict the ability of fraudsters to impersonate their brand or department. <br><br>

E164.com acts as the coordinating system for different DNO list operators and provides unified access to multiple market data via one interface.<br><br>

By integrating the DNO list you are able to reduce fraud transiting your service and protect consumers from financial harm.
